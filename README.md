A repo for a level design blockout with UE 5.6. 

First of all, I apologize because I use Unreal 5.6 instead of 5.5. The reason is I am currently doing research research and it takes lots of my memory. I am willing to follow the correct procedure if I get accepted by your company.  

# My steps to create the level blockout 
1. Brainstrom on pinterest and artstation. 
2. Create a rough shape grammar. 
3. Create 2D layout.
4. Create block palette and implement the 3D blockout.

# Notes
1. About shape grammar, although it's not a new concept, it still helpful to create the abstraction of level simply using circular nodes like tree. The concept was introduced by Joris Dorman through some of his papers.
2. I created the layout directly in Unreal using plane. The whole process takes me longer than I expected because I still learn the navigability in Unreal. I used Unity in almost all of my projects.
